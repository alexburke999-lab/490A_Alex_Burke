        <h2 class="card-title">Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project examines how artificial intelligence is reshaping the investment management and financial advice industry, using principles from managerial economics to analyze changes in productivity, costs, competition, and firm structure. The sector—anchored by over $540 billion in annual revenue and $145 trillion in assets under management—is highly fragmented, with most firms operating as small RIAs, creating uneven adoption of emerging technologies.</p>
        <p>AI is already transforming advisory workflows by automating routine tasks, enabling more personalized planning, expanding access to financial advice, and enhancing risk detection, while also introducing challenges such as algorithmic bias, regulatory scrutiny, and over-reliance on automated models.</p>
        <p>For early-career professionals, these shifts create both opportunities and obstacles: AI amplifies the value of communication, judgment, and problem-solving while reducing traditional entry-level analytical tasks and raising expectations for technical and ethical oversight.</p>
        <p>Through this project, I developed a clearer understanding of how AI is altering the industry’s economics and professional roles, and how my own strengths—communication, analytical reasoning, and adaptability—fit into a future where human insight and AI tools will work together to shape the next generation of financial advice.</p>
