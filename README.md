# Simple Starter Site

A minimal, responsive, accessible starter website built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or
2. Serve the folder locally for a nicer dev experience:

   - Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 5173`
   - Node (if installed): `npx http-server -p 5173`

Then visit `http://localhost:5173`.

## Customize

- Colors: tweak CSS variables at the top of `styles.css`.
- Content: edit sections in `index.html` (hero, features, about, contact).
- Behavior: adjust small interactions in `script.js`.

## Notes

- The contact form is demo-only (no backend). On submit, it shows a friendly message and clears the form.
- The site includes a mobile menu, skip link, and visible focus states for better accessibility.
